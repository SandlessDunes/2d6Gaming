            <h1>About 2d6 Gaming</h1>
            <p>
                Linda Leveoux and Lenny Limrock met in high school and always wanted a place where
                they could meet up with their friends to play board games, cards, and their weekly
                D&D adventures. They longed for the days of leaving their parents' basements, when
                they would no longer have to fight off the constant bombardments from siblings and
                parents alike. Flash forward ten years and 2d6 Gaming was born.
