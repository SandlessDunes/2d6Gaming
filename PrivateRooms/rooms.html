            <h1>Private Rooms and Tables at 2d6 Gaming</h1>
            <p>
                We strive to be here for our community and offer private rentals! Whether you would
                like a private room for a one-time or ongoing event, or would just like to reserve
                a table for you and your friends, the crew at 2d6 Gaming has your back.
            </p>
            <h3>Reserve a Table</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to our storefront, we dedicate the back room of our shop to you, our 
                patrons. We have sixteen tables in our spacious downtown location. We set aside
                ten of those tables for you, our lovely patron, to reserve. You can reach us on
                Discord or in-store to reserve a table. Table reservations can be made day of, if 
                available, or up to three months in advance. Reserving a table is <i><b>completely free</b></i>
                . If no one has claimed your reserved table after 15 minutes from your scheduled time, we will
                open the table up for general gaming. 
            </p>
            <h3>Reserving a Private Room</h3>
            <p>
                If you need a larger space, we have two private rooms which are available to rent.
                For a reasonable price of $30 a day, you can rent our fully-stoked private room. 
                Our private rooms has storage shelves to hold your gear or your gaming supplies while
                you're playing with your friends. The rooms are decorated with a massive gaming table 
                which seats up to 10 people. Rentals need at least a 24 hour notice and has a 24 hour 
                cancellation policy. You can come into the shop or reach out to us on Discord to rent 
                your private room!
